          <h3>Espresso</h3>
          <p>
            Espresso is a concentrated coffee beverage brewed by forcing hot
            water under pressure through finely-ground coffee beans. It is the
            base for many coffee drinks, including lattes, cappuccinos, and
            macchiatos.

            steamed milk, and milk foam. It is often topped with cocoa powder or
            cinnamon. Cappuccinos are known for their rich, creamy texture and
            strong coffee flavor.

          <p>
            A macchiato is a coffee drink made with espresso and a small amount
            of steamed milk or milk foam. The name "macchiato" means "stained"
            or "spotted" in Italian, referring to the way the milk is added to
            the espresso.
